What is GitHub?
===============

GitHub is basically Google Drive (x10) for coding.

  

Why should I care?
==================

This is like _the_ world for software development. Want to find cool projects? GitHub. Want to be a "real" techie? GitHub. Want to contribute to some of Google's projects? GitHub. Want to share your hard coding work? GitHub.

So what is it, really?
----------------------

> GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

GitHub is a place to store your code and projects, view other people's projects, and make copies of other people's projects for you to customize and contribute to. The basic idea is this:

1.  You find a cool project that someone made on GitHub
2.  You say "wicked! I'd love to work on this or try it out"
3.  You make a personal copy of the person's cool project ("clone the repo", in GitHub speak)
4.  You follow their sometimes-well-written documentation ("the README", in GitHub speak) or just try out different things to work on the project, change certain features, add to it, remove things, make improvements, personalize it, etc.
5.  Along the way, you track your work and changes so that if you mess up, you can go back to a previous version ("pull, add, commit, push", in GitHub speak)
6.  After you make some cool contributions to the project, you say "wicked! I'd love for the original creator to see my work or add it to their actual project"
7.  You submit your personal copy of the cool project to the original, to see if the person who originally made it wants to include your contributions ("submit a pull request", in GitHub speak)
8.  They say "OMG, these contributions are awesome! Let me include them in the main project" ("merge pull request", in GitHub speak)
9.  Now the process starts all over again, with someone else finding the cool project (that now has your contributions in it)
